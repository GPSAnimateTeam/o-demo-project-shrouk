# 🎬 Animate Project Template

This is a template for educational projects built with **Adobe Animate**.  
Here you will find the basic guidelines for how the team should work consistently.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/GPSAnimateTeam/animate-project-template


2. Create a **new branch** with your name or the task name:

   git checkout -b feature-task-name

   Example: `feature-geography-grade4-map`
3. Commit and push your work regularly:

   git add .
   git commit -m "describe what you changed"
   git push origin feature-task-name


---

## 🔄 Workflow

* Nobody should work directly on the `main` branch.
* All changes must go to a **new branch**.
* When finished, open a **Pull Request (PR)**:

  1. On GitHub → click **New Pull Request**.
  2. Select your branch → `main`.
  3. Write a clear description of what changed.
  4. Wait for review from the team leader.

---

## ✅ Branch Naming

* **feature-task-name** → for new features.
* **fix-task-name** → for bug fixes.


Examples:

* `feature-english-grade5-game`
* `fix-science-grade1-audio-sync`

---

## 📌 Task Management

* Tasks are tracked in the **Projects board** or **Issues**.
* Each member works only on their assigned task.
* After finishing, create a PR and link it to the related task.

---

## 📝 Commit Message Rules

We use a simplified **Conventional Commits** format:

### Format:

```
<type>: <short description>
```

### Types:

* **feat** → for a new feature

  ```
  feat: add grade 4 geography animation screen
  ```

* **fix** → for a bug fix

  ```
  fix: correct audio sync in science grade 1
  ```

* **docs** → for documentation changes (like README)

  ```
  docs: update setup instructions in README
  ```

* **style** → for code style/formatting changes (no logic impact)

  ```
  style: reformat timeline labels in animation file
  ```

* **refactor** → for code restructuring without changing behavior

  ```
  refactor: simplify scene loading logic
  ```

* **chore** → for maintenance or configuration (gitignore, CI/CD, etc.)

  ```
  chore: update gitignore to exclude cache files
  ```

### Tips:

* Keep it short (50–72 characters).
* If more details are needed, add them in a new line after the short description.
* Messages can be in English or simple wording, as long as they are clear.

## 🎯 Goal

* All code and assets are documented in GitHub.
* No work is lost or duplicated.
* Team collaboration is consistent and transparent.

```
